Backplane README
================

This Backplane Server implements both the [backplane-core-v2] [2]
specification and the previous [backplane-core-v1.2] [1] specifications.

Deployment configuration is detailed in this document.

Specifics for each of the Backplane versions is described in the following README files:

* [README12.md] [4]

* [README20.md] [5]


Deployment Configuration
------------------------

The deployment environment is Amazon AWS and the storage engine used is SimpleDB.

Each Backplane Server logical instance (hosted on AWS) is identified by its backplane-instance name.
SimpleDB is used for keeping Backplane Server's configuration data.

The Backplane Server learns its bootstrap configuration parameters from the following environment variables:

* `PARAM1`: The logical Backplane instance ID. Used to identify configuration data sets within SimpleDB
and allow multiple (AWS) instances to be part of the same logical Backplane Server deployment.

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Key ID for accessing SimpleDB.

* `AWS_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for accessing SimpleDB.

* `PARAM2`: Reporting domain for emails sent from Backplane server via log4j's SMTPAppender
(e.g., "samplebackplane.com").  Emails have a complete origin format of `${PARAM1}@${PARAM2}`.

* `PARAM3`: Destination for log4j email notifications (e.g., "backplane-email@homedomain.com").


Administrator Authentication
----------------------------

Administrators can access the Bus Provisioning API and update Bus Configuration data.
Administrator credentials are kept in the `<backplane-instance>_Admin` table:

* `USER`: admin username

* `PWDHASH`: admin password (hash)

To retrieve the generated metrics, you must add the `<backplane-instance>__bpMetricAuth` table:

* `USER`: metrics username

* `PWDHASH`: metrics password (hash)

These Backplane admin users are provisioned manually, e.g. using the [SimpleDB Shell] [6] tool.

To generate a password hash, see the HmacHashUtils class and its main() method.

For convenience a JAR file (and associated dependencies) are availabe under `/extra/hashutil/`
and password hashes can be generated by invoking:

        java -jar hashutil.jar


Building From Source
--------------------

This project requires the [Maven] [3] build tool.

        mvn package -DskipTests=true

To process the tests, you must have created an Amazon SimpleDB instance.
Use the following modification to the Maven build command (be sure to add your parameters):

        mvn package -DargLine="-DPARAM1=instanceid -DPARAM2=sample.com -DPARAM3=backplane-email@sample.com -DAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=key -DAWS_SECRET_KEY=secret"

Maven will create a WAR file for deployment in the `/target/` directory.
